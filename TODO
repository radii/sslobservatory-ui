 - "LOADING" div that goes away when we've successfully completed rendering
 - loading div should go to "failed" if no success in 15 seconds
 - new color scheme that doesn't make people assume I'm a blind wombat.
 - more web20ish UI elements.  I like the default github scheme.
 - fix date presentation, mix of JS Date and SQL datetime (ewww).
 - remove alert() on invalid SHA1 submission

more complicated UI things:
 - make all IPs hoverable or clickable to get whois info (pull github/vbfox?)
 - do the same for hostnames

Features:
 - search on CN (will require schema additions)
 - hash prefix support
